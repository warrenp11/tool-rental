## Description
Rent-A-Tool is a way for those who don't have enough room to store tools to still have access to them without spending a large amount of money.</br>

Our motivation for this app comes after getting stuck indoors due to covid, having things that need to be fixed around the house but not wanting to waste money and storage on tools. </br>

As someone who doesn't have enough room to keep many tools, but likes to do work around the house, I would like an easy way to obtain the tools I need without worrying about where to store them.  </br>

This is MERN stack single-page application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on user demand.
